TI Davinci DSP devices
=======================

Binding status: Unstable - Subject to changes for DT clocks

The TI Davinci family of SoCs usually contains a TI DSP Core sub-system that
is used to offload some of the processor-intensive tasks or algorithms, for
achieving various system level goals.

The processor cores in the sub-system usually contain additional sub-modules
like L1 and/or L2 caches/SRAMs, an Interrupt Controller, an external memory
controller, a dedicated local power/sleep controller etc. The DSP processor
core used in Davinci SoCs is usually a C674x DSP CPU.

DSP Device Node:
================
Each DSP Core sub-system is represented as a single DT node.

Required properties:
--------------------
The following are the mandatory properties:

- compatible:		Should be one of the following,
			    "ti,da850-dsp" for DSPs on OMAP-L138 SoCs

- reg:			Should contain an entry for each value in 'reg-names'.
			Each entry should have the memory region's start address
			and the size of the region, the representation matching
			the parent node's '#address-cells' and '#size-cells' values.

- reg-names:		Should contain strings with the following names, each
			representing a specific internal memory region or a
			specific register space,
			     "l2sram", "l1pram", "l1dram", "host1cfg", "chipsig_base"

- interrupts: 		Should contain the interrupt number used to receive the
			interrupts from the DSP. The value should follow the
			interrupt-specifier format as dictated by the
			'interrupt-parent' node.

- memory-region:	phandle to the reserved memory node to be associated
			with the remoteproc device. The reserved memory node
			can be a CMA memory node, and should be defined as
			per the bindings in
			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt

Optional properties:
--------------------
- interrupt-parent:	phandle to the interrupt controller node. This property
			is needed if the device node hierarchy doesn't have an
			interrupt controller.

Undefined properties:
---------------------
The following properties are not yet defined, but will become mandatory as and
when the corresponding bindings are defined

- clocks: 		Should contain the device's input clock

- resets:		Should contain the phandle to the reset controller node
			managing the resets for this device, and a reset
			specifier.


Example:
--------

	/* DA850 DTS file */
	{
		dsp: dsp@11800000 {
			compatible = "ti,da850-dsp";
			reg = <0x11800000 0x40000>,
			      <0x11e00000 0x8000>,
			      <0x11f00000 0x8000>,
			      <0x01c14044 0x4>,
			      <0x01c14174 0x8>;
			reg-names = "l2sram", "l1pram", "l1dram", "host1cfg",
				    "chipsig";
			interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
			interrupts = <28>;
			status = "disabled";
		};

	};

	/* OMAP-L138 LCDK Board file */
	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		dsp_cma_pool: dsp_cma@c3000000 {
                        compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
                        reg = <0xc3000000 0x1000000>;
                        reusable;
                        status = "okay";
                };
	};

	&dsp {
		status = "okay";
